        <p class="blog-post-meta">April 9, 2023 â€¢ 95% Human Written</p>
        
        <p>Insanely often we say on our website that the ability to communicate with people correctly is 90% of success in any career. Believe me, even developers who rarely <a href="best-soft-skills.html">communicate</a> with people need to be able to do it right. Today I want to talk about books that helped me to properly build my business conversations and learn everything I need in the shortest possible dialogues without taking a lot of time from colleagues and without wasting a lot of my extra time. Here is a list of books that I have prepared for you.</p>

        <p><a href="https://skillshare.eqcm.net/c/3876500/298081/4650"><img src="../blogs/images/skillshare.png" style="padding: 10px 0;"/></a></p>

        <h2>Never Eat Alone</h2>
        <p>"Never Eat Alone" by Keith Ferrazzi is a captivating book that explores the power of networking and building relationships in both personal and professional life. The book emphasizes the importance of nurturing relationships and building a strong <a href="self-promotion.html">personal brand</a>. Ferrazzi provides practical advice and strategies on how to network effectively, make meaningful connections, and turn those connections into opportunities.</p>
        <p>The book is well-written and engaging, with numerous real-world examples that make it easy to understand and relate to. Ferrazzi's writing style is conversational and relatable, making it an enjoyable read.</p>

        </script>

        <p>One of the key takeaways from the book is the concept of "relationship currency," where Ferrazzi emphasizes that building relationships is not just about what you can get from others, but also what you can give. This approach of building genuine relationships based on mutual trust and respect is refreshing and practical.</p>

        <h2>The Art of Strategy (Bonus)</h2>
        <p>I put this book in the bonus group for a reason. The thing is, it's not really about <a href="soft-skills.html">communication</a>. This book built in me an algorithm by which I could achieve the goals and objectives set earlier from the dialogue. This is an excellent resource for project managers who often negotiate and negotiate with someone.</p>

        <p>The book teaches building the right strategy of behavior in general and in <a href="start-business.html">business</a>, work and life, not only in communication. This book is gripping, and the story doesn't let go until the very end. When I read it, I really liked its structure - everything is very consistent and easy to explain.</p>
        <p>To my regret, not much is said about the book and few of my acquaintances have heard about it at all, which is a pity, because it contains a huge amount of practical advice on how to properly build a strategy for your life, how to achieve goals correctly, representing it all as game theory. I recommend reading!</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Developing your networking skills is a key component of career development. Reading books that focus on personal growth and career development can be a great way to improve your networking skills and open up new opportunities. The books listed above are just a few examples of the many great books available on this topic. By investing time in developing your networking skills, you can build meaningful connections, learn new skills, and achieve your career goals.</p>
        <p>I stopped only at those books that I myself read or began to read and read now. I did not add books to this collection that everyone is talking about, but I myself have not heard anything about them, because in this case the article would lose its relevance and meaning.</p>

        <p class="blog-post-meta">Feb 18, 2023</p>
        
        <p>I want to talk about ChatGPT. A very popular thing lately, but only now I managed to test its functionality enough and am ready to share my experience with you today - how I use ChatGPT in my daily life. I will also tell a little about my personal attitude to artificial intelligence and share my opinion on why we will not lose our jobs. About everything in order.</p>
      
        <p><a href="https://skillshare.eqcm.net/c/3876500/298081/4650"><img src="../blogs/images/skillshare.png" style="padding: 10px 0;"/></a></p>

        <h2>Code</h2>
        <p>This is the ChatGPT feature that I use every day. Now I work as a freelancer. I develop websites, and this recently popular tool helps me with this. Most often, I turn to artificial intelligence for help when I need to write CSS styles for blocks, buttons and navbars. I'm perfectly capable of doing this myself, but one day I decided to trust ChatGPT to style the button for me. It turned out well, and I decided that now I will not waste my time on this, but will outsource it to ChatGPT.</p>
        <img src="../blogs/images/ChatGPT - Code.png" alt='ChatGPT - Code'>
        <p class="image-desc text-center">ChatGPT - Code</p>
        <p>In general, I like the fact that some part of the work can be outsourced to artificial intelligence. That's part of the <a href="get-job.html">job</a>. Large and complex tasks come out somehow crooked and do not always work. So, for example, I gave him the task to write me an endless scroll for a web page, while I myself fill the blocks with content. ChatGPT wrote me this scroll, but it didn't work. I did not look and analyze what the error was, but quickly wrote everything myself from scratch, however, I expected that AI would cope with this - it did not.</p>
        
        <script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js?client=ca-pub-5726911142858125"
              crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
              style="display:block"
              data-ad-format="fluid"
              data-ad-layout-key="-fb+5w+4e-db+86"
              data-ad-client="ca-pub-5726911142858125"

        <script>
              (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>

        <p>However, when it comes to code, I think ChatGPT makes some of the monotonous work easier anyway. Going back to the button style example, I want to say that my favorite thing in my life is to design for my sites, and therefore I spend a huge amount of time on it. One button style I can do for almost an hour. But with the help of AI, I just specified a color palette and got a button style that suited me the second time.</p>
        <p>ChatGPT's ability to code opens up huge possibilities. The very first thing I thought about when I received the finished code for my order was that <a href="learning-python.html">learning to program</a> is becoming easier and more interesting. I think that the need for <a href="free-courses.html">courses</a> and tutorials will not disappear, but AI is a great helper and hint, because it not only writes code, but also explains the logic of writing it.</p>

              <p class="card-text mb-auto">What's up, nerds? Today I was doing my routine and doing a sitemap for my site and I thought why not write...</p>

            </div>
          </div>
        </div>

        <p>For example, I asked ChatGPT to write me a <a href="best-hard-skills.html">python</a> script to generate a sitemap, since I work on the site regularly and this function would be useful to me. In addition to the working script, I received explanations of each function, how everything works, why certain libraries are used, and even a theory about what a sitemap is.</p>
        <img src="../blogs/images/ChatGPT - Python Code.png" alt='ChatGPT - Python Code'>
        <p class="image-desc text-center">ChatGPT - Python Code</p>
        <p>AI mistakes happen. In addition to the examples I gave before, I also tested ChatGPT on writing a simple function that calculates the Fibonacci sequence. An absolutely classic problem, the solution of which can be found on the first site of any search engine, but I received an error code. I was surprised. This is partly why I believe that programmers do not lose their jobs.</p>
        <p>This is a very heated discussion, and I have no particular desire to enter into it. I'll just say that AI is based on existing code, on the basis of something created. Thus, its existence will simplify routine work (as in my examples), but AI will not be able to create something fundamentally new and invent a new data compression algorithm, at least for now. So you won't lose your job, don't worry.</p>

        <h2>Search</h2>
        <p>Recently, ChatGPT has replaced the Google search engine for me. Think for yourself, AI generates answers from everything that is available on the network, so why would I need an endless <a href="sitemap-generators.html">search engine</a> with an infinite number of identical answers if I can use AI. It's about simple answers. For example, now I do not google - the best restaurants in Vancouver, but I ask in the AI chat and I get not sites with the same information and the same restaurant tops, but clear answers.</p>
        <p>In this regard, ChatGPT does a great job of finding short answers to clear questions. Here, without further ado, I get the answer to my question. For example, the first thing I asked ChatGPT was to write a declaration of love and immediately received a template where you just need to change the name. Brilliant.</p>
        <img src="../blogs/images/ChatGPT - Search.png" alt='ChatGPT - Search'>
        <p class="image-desc text-center">ChatGPT - Search</p>
        <p>I asked a clear question and got a clear answer. I don’t need to look among hundreds of sites for rules for writing declarations of love, for advice on what to write there and what not - I just got an answer. This saves a lot of time. Of course, this is an example, no need to send a declaration of love generated by AI to anyone. Why? Because you will be quickly figured out.</p>
        <p>On the same day, I discovered a tool called <a href="https://contentatscale.ai">AI Detector</a>. Another ingenious thing that predicts if the text was generated by artificial intelligence. The result of a declaration of love is presented below.</p>
        <img src="../blogs/images/AI Detector - Interface.png" alt='AI Detector - Interface'>
        <p class="image-desc text-center">AI Detector - Interface</p>
        <p>The tool gives accuracy and the probability that the text is not written by a person and is quite accurate. I checked 10 texts, and he guessed 9 cases out of 10, which is very worthy. I didn’t want to write a separate article about this tool, since there’s not much to talk about there, but I recommend paying attention to it, because sooner or later you will have to check the text not for uniqueness, as in scientific papers, but for whether it was generated neural network.</p>

        <h2>Jokes</h2>
        <p>Yes, I read jokes generated by AI and you know what? I love them, they are very funny. I understand that I use ChatGPT in a very narrow way, it is capable of much more and can make my life even easier, but to be honest, I don’t need more yet.</p>
        <img src="../blogs/images/ChatGPT - Jokes.png" alt='ChatGPT - Jokes'>
        <p class="image-desc text-center">ChatGPT - Jokes</p>
        <p>Furthermore, I ask questions in the chat that I want to know the answers to like I did in the search engine, I ask for help in writing code, and sometimes I want to hear a funny joke. I don't need it for more. Honestly. I would also like AI to generate memes for me, which I could add to <a href="quit-job.html">conversational articles</a> where screenshots are not particularly needed, but so far ChatGPT does not know how. I would like AI to generate entire videos according to the description in order to perceive information visually and replace YouTube for itself, but there are no such advanced neural networks yet.</p>
        <p>I use ChatGPT very limited, but this is enough for me. Enough to work, for everyday life and even to have a little fun. I think many will agree with me. Share how you use ChatGPT on our <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/becomingnerd/">Reddit community</a>. We are always welcome to new faces there. Good luck!</p>

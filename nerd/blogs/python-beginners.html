        <p>Hey! There are quite a lot of articles on Python on our site, simply because we consider this programming language one of the most popular, simple, and functional. Another programming language is not required at all. Today we'll briefly talk about why Python in particular (very briefly, don't worry - we think it's important), and then move on to why we're here - educational <a href="../resources.html">resources</a> to help you learn Python to scratch and succeed. </p>
        <p>Keep in mind that I have arranged the resources in order of complexity and sequence. You can easily skip some of them, but moving up - from the last to the first - is better not to. You will quickly become frustrated due to the level of difficulty and balance.</p>

        <h2>Why Python?</h2>
        <p>As you probably know, there are a lot of programming languages and each one is used for its own specific purposes. Why Python? There are several reasons for this:</p>
        <ul>
          <p>ðŸ“Œ Its versatility. Programmers joke - if you don't know what programming language to learn - learn python. If you don't know what programming language will be popular next year - repeat python. And indeed it is. Python is used in many areas - in working with data, in writing complex algorithms, and even in developing functionality for a website.</p>
          <p>ðŸ“Œ Its simplicity. Python, when compared to other programming languages, is a fairly simple language. It has a simple syntax and understandable logic. Just look at the meme, which compares the syntax of Java (another popular programming language) and Python.</p> 
        </ul>
        <img src="../blogs/images/python-java-meme.png" alt="Java VS Python meme">
        <p class="image-desc text-center">Java VS Python meme</p>
        <p>Now that we have figured out why to learn and have a knowledge of Python, we can move on to educational resources that I highly recommend to you. I'll talk about each separately, but while you're reading, keep in mind that each resource from this list is literally a gold bar, a step forward to becoming a Jedi Master in Python.</p>

        <h2>Codecombat</h2>
        <p>I'll start with a surprise. In general, Codecombat positions itself as a platform for teaching programming to children, but I do not agree with this. In fact, this is a platform that teaches not the syntax of Python, but the thinking of a programmer, logic, and the correct way of thinking through an online game. The format is amazing. When I was preparing to write this article, I myself played it for several hours and had only positive emotions.</p>
        <img src="../blogs/images/Code Combat Main Page.png" alt="Code Combat Main Page">
        <p class="image-desc text-center">Code Combat Main Page (<a href="https://codecombat.com/">source</a>)</p>
        <p>Again, this is a simple online game, the main goal of which is to teach the player (student) to think logically. The game conveys the logic with which loops, arrays, conditional statements, and other basic lines of Python code are written. Before you get to know the syntax itself, you should take a closer look at the logic. So, you will perceive documentation, books, and courses easier. And do not be embarrassed that the game is for children - I believe that this is not so, and even developers with 10 years of experience will be delighted.</p>

        <h2>Head First Python</h2>
        <p>"Head First Python" by Paul Barry is a unique and engaging book that teaches Python programming to beginners. The book uses a visual approach to teaching, with plenty of illustrations, diagrams, and real-world examples to make learning Python fun and easy.</p>
        <img src="../blogs/images/Head First Python - Modules Section.png" alt="Head First Python - Modules Section">
        <p class="image-desc text-center">Head First Python - Modules Section (<a href="http://bedford-computing.co.uk/learning/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Head-First-Python.pdf">source</a>)</p>
        <p>One of the key strengths of the book is its focus on practical examples. The author provides plenty of code examples that demonstrate how to use Python to solve real-world problems, which makes the learning experience more engaging and relevant. For instance, this book helped me a lot with real examples in my final year at university. The book also includes exercises and quizzes that help reinforce key concepts and ensure learners are retaining what they've learned.</p>
        <p>The book uses a conversational tone and a visual layout that makes it easy to follow and understand. The author breaks down complex concepts into manageable sections and uses illustrations and diagrams to explain concepts in a way that is easy to grasp.</p>

        <script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js?client=ca-pub-5726911142858125"
              crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
              style="display:block"
              data-ad-format="fluid"
              data-ad-layout-key="-fb+5w+4e-db+86"
              data-ad-client="ca-pub-5726911142858125"
              data-ad-slot="8075272857"></ins>
        <script>
              (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>

        <p>Not for me, but for somebody, it may not be the best choice for learners who prefer a more traditional approach to learning programming. The visual and conversational style of the book may not be appealing to everyone, and some learners may prefer a more text-heavy approach.</p>
        <p>"Head First Python" is an excellent resource for beginners who want a fun and engaging introduction to Python programming. The book's unique visual approach, practical examples, and conversational tone make it a great choice for learners who are looking for an enjoyable and effective way to learn Python. "Head First Python" is unquestionably a book you should look at if you're new to Python and want to learn the language in a fun and interesting way.</p>
        <p>The book is available via the <a href="http://bedford-computing.co.uk/learning/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Head-First-Python.pdf">link</a>.</p>

        <h2>Learnpython</h2>
        <p>If all resources on the Internet are literature, then Learn Python in it is "War and Peace". A true classic and a great resource to get you started on your programming language journey. This is the best collection of tutorials with which a beginner is best to start. Learn Python covers all programming language basics. After passing all the tasks and tests, you can get an excellent base that can be improved in the future (with the help of other resources on this list).</p>
        <img src="../blogs/images/Learn Python Workspace.png" alt="Learn Python Workspace">
        <p class="image-desc text-center">Learn Python Workspace (<a href="https://www.learnpython.org/">source</a>)</p>
        <p>I advise you to treat this resource as interactive documentation. It's the documentation. If you're serious about learning Python, or any programming language in general, you'll still need to come across programming language documentation sooner or later. It's much more practical to read the docs early, so you can quickly get a feel for what the developer's job is like in general.</p>
        <p>This resource has probably the best Python documentation that I know, and I know a lot of resources, believe me. As I said, this is a classic, among the classics, and for a start you only need knowledge of English, and if English is your native language, then you should not have any problems with these materials at all.</p>

        <div class="alert alert-light" role="alert">
          ðŸ“Œ <a href="doc-resources.html">What Are The Best Technical Documentation Resources for Developer?</a>
        </div>  

        <h2>Python Standard Library</h2>
        <p>If we are talking about documentation, then it is worth mentioning this resource. A thorough resource for Python developers, the Python Standard Library <a href="doc-resources.html">documentation</a> offers in-depth details about the built-in modules and libraries that come with the Python <a href="best-languages.html">programming language</a>.</p>
        <img src="../blogs/images/Python Standard Library - Docs.png" alt="Python Standard Library - Docs">
        <p class="image-desc text-center">Python Standard Library - Docs (<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/">source</a>)</p>
        <p>Finding information on certain modules or functions is simple because of the documentation's excellent organization. Each module is well-documented, with details on what it does, how it works, and how to use it. Code samples and descriptions of the different arguments and parameters for each function are also included in the documentation. The broad coverage of the included modules and libraries in the Python Standard Library documentation is one of its most notable aspects. The documentation covers a wide range of subjects, such as <a href="networking-books.html">networking</a>, regular expressions, file input/output, and many more.</p>
        <p>The Python Standard Library documentation is also regularly updated to include the latest changes and features. As a result, it may be relied upon by Python developers who want to stay current with the language's most recent modifications. The documentation is simple to use and has a variety of tools and resources, including community forums and connections to other material. With a variety of forums and online resources accessible for developers to use, the community support for Python is also quite strong.</p>

        <h2>HackerRank</h2>
        <p>Now that you've read a lot of documentation, books, and tutorials, it's time to start programming. Yes, we are starting to do this only now - that's how it should be, believe me. For training, I offer you a free resource for training a huge stack of hard skills - HackerRank. The platforms are convenient, fast, and do not need to download anything - what you need for beginners.</p>
        <img src="../blogs/images/Hacker Rank - Discussion Tab.png" alt="Hacker Rank - Discussion Tab">
        <p class="image-desc text-center">Hacker Rank - Discussion Tab (<a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/python">source</a>)</p>
        <p>This is a huge sandbox with Python tasks of varying levels of complexity, ranging from simple string output to more complex mathematical calculations. This platform is also on this list because during the execution of each task while writing each script, it is possible to look at the code of other users, and their solutions, which can be a huge number.</p>
        <p>So, you will get acquainted with other manners of writing code, with the logic of other developers - beginners and pros. The decisions of other users are always written in the Discissions tab (where, in fact, there should only be hints), but this is the peculiarity of the platform.</p>

        <h2>OverAPI</h2>
        <p>This resource is more of a bedtime read than a course or tutorial. OverAPI is a comprehensive online resource for developers that provides quick access to code snippets, shortcuts, and references for a wide range of programming languages and technologies. The OverAPI documentation is an impressive collection of cheat sheets that are organized by topic and programming language.</p>
        <img src="../blogs/images/OverAPI - Docs.png" alt="OverAPI - Docs">
        <p class="image-desc text-center">OverAPI - Docs (<a href="https://overapi.com/">source</a>)</p>
        <p>Because of the documentation's clear organization and ease of use, developers may easily find the information they need. The cheat sheets give developers a plethora of information, including syntax, instructions, and examples, making it simple for them to comprehend and put the ideas they are learning to use.</p>
        <p>One of the most impressive features of the OverAPI documentation is the live search function. This allows developers to quickly search for the information they need without having to navigate through multiple pages. The documentation also includes a range of resources and tools, including links to official documentation and popular forums for each technology. The cheat sheets are regularly updated to include the latest information, which makes the OverAPI documentation a reliable resource for developers. The website is simple to use on a variety of devices because of its adaptable design and user-friendly layout.</p>

        <h2>Kaggle</h2>
        <p>Another resource for learning about data manipulation and visualization. I will say right away that Kaggle is not exactly a learning platform. There are very few courses here and, to be honest, they are not presented in the best possible way. Even for me, a person with <a href="work-experience.html">experience</a>, some things seemed too confusing.</p>
        <img src="../blogs/images/Kaggle Courses.png" alt="Kaggle Courses">
        <p class="image-desc text-center">Kaggle Courses (<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/learn">source</a>)</p>
        <p>The courses here are quite superficial and boring. Someone will ask - why then did you put this resource in the selection. Everything is very simple - I will answer. Kaggle is a huge sandbox where everyone has the opportunity to publish their datasets, as well as the code for them.</p>
        <p>Competitions are held on datasets, internal prizes (medals) are given for various achievements on the site, and the community is such that you can not leave this site for hours. In fact, it's a data scientist's paradise, as well as a great platform where you can build a great portfolio with the knowledge and skills you've already acquired. That is why I placed this resource at the very end.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>I really hope I didn't steal your desire to learn Python from following my list. In fact, there is nothing terrible in this programming language. It is simple and versatile. With him, as an IT specialist, you definitely will not be lost. I specifically told you about such numerous resources. My goal was not to make you walk through each of these steps but to give you a choice. However, the resources are arranged in a sequence in which it is best to move from top to bottom. So, you can skip a few points, but itâ€™s better not to move from the last to the penultimate one. Here's my advice to you!</p>
        <p>I wish you great success in your studies - do not be afraid, there is nothing complicated. You just need to consistently and slowly move towards your goal, not jump from one resource to another if something doesnâ€™t work out and something doesnâ€™t go according to plan. Good luck!</p>

        <p class="blog-post-meta">March 30, 2023 â€¢ 93% Human Written</p>
        
        <p>In today's world of technology, it's easy to think that the only skills that matter in IT are <a href="best-hard-skills.html">technical skills</a>. While technical skills are undoubtedly important, soft skills are equally important in the IT industry. I'll discuss the value of soft skills in IT, what they are, and how to acquire them in this post.</p>   
        <p>What are Soft Skills? <a href="soft-skills.html">Soft skills</a> refer to a person's ability to interact with others effectively. They are the personal attributes that enable someone to communicate, collaborate, and work well with others. In contrast, technical skills are specific abilities related to a particular job or industry.</p>

        <p><a href="https://resumeio.sjv.io/c/3876500/1503720/17609?subId1=becomingnerd"><img src="../blogs/images/resumeio.jpeg" style="padding: 10px 0;"/></a></p>

        <p>In the modern workplace, soft skills are becoming more and more crucial, particularly in the realm of IT. While technical skills are still essential for IT <a href="expert-predictions.html">professionals</a>, employers are now placing a greater emphasis on soft skills when <a href="hundred-interviews.html">hiring</a> and promoting employees.</p>
        
        <h2>Statistics</h2>
        <p>According to a study conducted by LinkedIn, 57% of leaders say that soft skills are more important than hard skills. In fact, the top five most in-demand soft skills in the IT industry include creativity, persuasion, collaboration, adaptability, and time management.</p>
        <center><img src="../blogs/images/Soft Skills Statistics.png" alt='Soft Skills Statistics' style="width: 75%;"></center>
        <p class="image-desc text-center">Soft Skills Statistics</p>
        <p>According to a poll conducted by the Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM), 91% of HR professionals place a high priority on soft skills when hiring new employees. Employers need people with great <a href="best-soft-skills.html">communication</a>, problem-solving, and critical thinking abilities, the poll revealed.</p>
        
        <script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js?client=ca-pub-5726911142858125"

        <ins class="adsbygoogle"

              data-ad-layout-key="-fb+5w+4e-db+86"

        </script>

        <p>Another survey by the Career Advisory Board found that 77% of <a href="quit-job.html">employers</a> believe that soft skills are just as important as technical skills. In addition, 16% of those surveyed said that they have dismissed an employee due to a lack of soft skills.</p>
        <p>The importance of soft skills is not limited to just the hiring process. IT professionals who possess strong soft skills are also more likely to receive promotions and advance in their careers. A survey by Robert Half found that 64% of IT executives said that they consider soft skills to be very important when promoting employees.</p>
        <p>Despite the importance of soft skills in IT, many professionals in the industry may not have had the opportunity to develop these skills. In fact, a survey by Udemy found that only 33% of IT professionals have received soft skills training from their employers.</p>

        <h2>Soft Skills</h2>
        <p>So how can IT professionals develop their soft skills? One way is to seek out training and development opportunities, either through their employer or through external sources such as online courses and workshops. Another way is to practice these skills in their daily work, such as by communicating more effectively with colleagues and clients, or by collaborating more closely with team members.</p>
        <p>Examples of soft skills include communication, problem-solving, critical thinking, time management, teamwork, adaptability, and leadership. These skills are essential in the IT industry because IT professionals often work in teams, interact with clients, and communicate technical concepts to non-technical people.</p>

        <p>The Importance of Soft Skills in IT Soft skills are critical in the IT industry because they enable IT professionals to communicate with non-technical stakeholders effectively. IT professionals often work on complex projects that require collaboration with people from different departments, including project managers, business analysts, and clients. Soft skills help IT professionals to communicate technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders and explain the business value of IT projects.</p>

        <p>Additionally, IT professionals with strong soft skills are better equipped to handle workplace challenges. They can work well under pressure, adapt to changes, and solve problems creatively. Soft skills also enable IT professionals to provide excellent customer service and support, leading to higher levels of client satisfaction.</p>

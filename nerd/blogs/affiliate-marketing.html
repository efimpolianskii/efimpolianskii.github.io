        <p>Hello everyone, nerds. Today we would like to talk more about affiliate marketing. Since our site aims to be for you, the readers, a site with useful resources, and not Wikipedia, in this article we have selected for you the best resources that will help you understand how affiliate marketing works in detail.</p>
        <p>What's more, the resources on this list are great for <a href="interview-preparation.html">interview preparation</a> for any affiliate marketing position (tech support, affiliate manager, marketer, and more). Please keep in mind that some companies will be listed below and their lines of business will be briefly described. This is not advertising - we do not advertise any services of companies, but we present you with extremely useful material that you can read and familiarize yourself with. I present to you the list that we, together with a small team of marketers, have compiled for you:</p>

        <p><a href="https://resumeio.sjv.io/c/3876500/1503720/17609?subId1=becomingnerd"><img src="../blogs/images/resumeio.jpeg" style="padding: 10px 0;"/></a></p>

        <h2>IREV</h2>
        <p>IREV is an affiliate marketing company that helps businesses to boost their online presence and revenue through their affiliate marketing services. They work with a variety of industries, including health and wellness, beauty, and e-commerce.</p>
        <p>IREV offers a range of affiliate marketing services, including affiliate program management, influencer marketing, and affiliate recruitment. They also provide reporting and analysis to help businesses track their performance and make data-driven decisions.</p>  
        
        <script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js?client=ca-pub-5726911142858125"
              crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
              style="display:block"
              data-ad-format="fluid"
              data-ad-layout-key="-fb+5w+4e-db+86"
              data-ad-client="ca-pub-5726911142858125"
              data-ad-slot="8075272857"></ins>
        <script>
              (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>

        <p>One of the key benefits of working with IREV is their team's experience and expertise in the affiliate marketing industry. They stay up-to-date with the latest trends and best practices to ensure their clients are getting the most effective strategies for their business.</p>
        <img src="../blogs/images/IREV - Glossary Page.png" alt="IREV - Glossary Page">
        <p class="image-desc text-center">IREV - Glossary Page (<a href="https://docs.irev.com/">source</a>)</p>
        <p>However, more valuable for us is their documentation on the official website, namely the glossary, which is available at the <a href="https://irev.com/affiliate-marketing-glossary">link</a>. Here are collected all the main terms that you will come across when analyzing the affiliate marketing industry on your own. Explanations of terms are described in great detail and real examples are often given, which speed up the understanding of basic business processes.</p>
        <p>If you're looking for a book on affiliate marketing, forget it. What is the point of reading books where 95% of the material is unnecessary letters, when you can freely read a glossary from a company that makes money on it, whose specialists specially create such training materials to make it easier to interact with partners. This is the case when tutorials are better than books.</p>

        <h2>CJ Affiliate</h2>
        <p>We thought for a long time with the team what resources are best for you to choose and came to the conclusion that the most effective and useful resources will be blogs of companies whose <a href="start-business.html">business</a> mostly consists of affiliate marketing. The fact is that such companies have blogs, among which you can find a lot of useful information about what affiliate marketing is in general and how it works in every detail. Often such logs are written for potential partners and customers of their SaaS, so they are written carefully and in great detail. One such blog is the <a href="https://www.cj.com/what-is-affiliate-marketing">CJ Affiliate blog</a>.</p>
        <img src="../blogs/images/CJ Affiliate - Blog Page.png" alt="CJ Affiliate - Blog Page">
        <p class="image-desc text-center">CJ Affiliate - Blog Page</p>
        <p>CJ Affiliate (formerly known as Commission Junction) is one of the largest affiliate marketing networks, connecting advertisers with publishers. It was founded in 1998 and is based in Santa Barbara, California. One of the biggest advantages of CJ Affiliate is the vast network of advertisers and publishers, allowing for a wide range of partnerships and opportunities for affiliates. They offer a user-friendly platform and a range of tools and resources to help affiliates <a href="optimize-webpage.html">optimize</a> their campaigns and track their performance.</p>
        <p>CJ Affiliate offers a variety of commission structures, including pay-per-sale, pay-per-lead, and pay-per-click, giving affiliates flexibility in how they earn commissions. They also offer real-time reporting and analytics to track performance and optimize campaigns.</p>
        <p>However, you and I are not investors, and it is not so important for us what the company does, rather, what matters to us is how it presents it to us, because we firstly evaluate the valuable theoretical material presented to us. Here this material is presented in a simpler and more concise form and is perfect for those who do not particularly want to delve into and learn everything in great detail. This material is suitable for those who want to understand in 20 minutes what everyone around is talking about and what there is so much noise about.</p>

        <h2>Affiliate Summit</h2>
        <p>Affiliate Summit is a leading blog page dedicated to the affiliate <a href="books-marketing.html">marketing</a> industry. The blog offers a wealth of information and insights into the world of affiliate marketing, from industry news and trends to practical tips and advice for marketers.</p>
        <img src="../blogs/images/Affiliate Summit - Blog Page.png" alt="Affiliate Summit - Blog Page">
        <p class="image-desc text-center">Affiliate Summit - Blog Page (<a href="https://www.affiliatesummit.com/blog">source</a>)</p>
        <p>Affiliate Summit blog has the diversity of its content. Whether you are new to affiliate marketing or an experienced marketer, you are sure to find valuable insights and resources to help you grow your business. In addition to the informative blog posts, the Affiliate Summit blog also offers a range of other resources, including webinars, podcasts, and events. These resources provide a great opportunity to learn from industry experts and stay up-to-date with the latest trends and best practices.</p>

        <script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js?client=ca-pub-5726911142858125"
              crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
              style="display:block"
              data-ad-format="fluid"
              data-ad-layout-key="-fb+5w+4e-db+86"
              data-ad-client="ca-pub-5726911142858125"
              data-ad-slot="8075272857"></ins>
        <script>
              (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>

        <p>Be sure to check out their old blog, there is a lot of useful and interesting information, but I still want to recommend that you pay attention to the IREV glossary (first paragraph), then you will read this blog not as boring literature, but more consciously and effectively.</p>

        <h2>ClickBank</h2>
        <p><a href="https://www.clickbank.com/how-clickbank-works/">ClickBank</a> Another large and fairly well-known company, which is perhaps the largest representative and platform in the affiliate market. I think that many have heard about her, and those who have not heard about it will undoubtedly hear as soon as they learn a little more about affiliates.</p>
        <img src="../blogs/images/ClickBank - How it Works Page.png" alt="ClickBank - How it Works Page">
        <p class="image-desc text-center">ClickBank - How it Works Page</p>
        <p>Again, in their blog, the information is presented and explained as if you were already a user of their platform. In this resource and previous ones, it does not matter. You can safely skip the moments where there are instructions like - press this, and then press this, and here you need to enter this. Pay attention only to the theory, you are here for it.</p>
        <p>The theoretical material about affiliate marketing is presented here perfectly. What I like the most is that potential clients are told here how everything works step by step - first this, and then that. In other words, even a child or a 90-year-old deaf pensioner can understand what is happening.</p>
        <p>In fact, you donâ€™t even need to redirect somewhere and the material at the link that I attached above will be more than enough for a start (then, if you want, you can develop your knowledge and skills in this area with other materials).</p>

        <h2>Nichehack</h2>
        <p>On <a href="https://nichehacks.com/topics/affiliate-marketing-101-o5EbLw">Nichehack</a> you can find many articles on absolutely different topics, including affiliate marketing. The team and I hesitated for a long time whether to add this resource to our article, because many can be confused by the dates of publications. In particular, the newest article was written about a year ago.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, we thought that the theoretical material on this topic has not changed during this time. The material is not particularly different from articles and blogs of companies a week ago, so this resource still made it to the list. According to the link that I attached above, there are only 10 articles that are written by different authors and are equally simple and accessible.</p>
        <img src="../blogs/images/Nichehack - Affiliate Marketing Topic.png" alt="Nichehack - Affiliate Marketing Topic">
        <p class="image-desc text-center">Nichehack - Affiliate Marketing Topic</p>
        <p>Articles are large in volume, so be prepared to spend up to an hour of your free time studying the material. Everything is accompanied by examples, illustrations and jokes. Perfect. Once again I will say - do not pay attention to the "antiquity" of these materials, they are still relevant and are of value to you and me.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>The purpose of this article was not to explain to you what affiliate marketing is - there are already a huge pile of resources for this. Among this heap of resources, we have selected exactly those that are worth paying attention to, for which it is not a pity to waste your other valuable time. We've wasted our time for you. Good luck!</p>

        <p class="blog-post-meta">Jan 10, 2023</p>
        
        <p>Today I would like to share my story about how I got into IT. I will say right away that I do not consider my path to be a reference one, it is far from ideal and do not consider it as such, please. This is just my opinion and how to get started in IT without pain.</p>
        <p>At university, I studied computer and cyber security. During the entire period of study, I naively believed that by working in my specialty, I would automatically work in IT. How wrong I was. I realized that I was wrong only when I graduated from the university, got into the big world and passed the first (serious, and not looking for a part-time job as during my studies) interviews.</p>
        <p>In fact, only after university I realized that all this time I was studying to be a manager, in the field of IT, but still a manager.</p>
        <div>
          <a href="https://kinsta.com?kaid=TUDZTQKSSIWU"><img src="images/kinsta.png" style="width: 100%; margin: 10px 0;"/></a>
        </div>
        <p>Don't get me wrong, I don't think it's bad. It's just that in my opinion it is impossible to be a successful manager without working with your hands, without having worked in IT yourself.</p>
        <p>Before looking for a job, I faced the main question - if I donâ€™t go to work in my university specialty, then where will I go to work in IT and what do I need to be able to do for this.</p>
        <p>It's funny that the question - what do I need to be able to do - IT specialists ask themselves every day.</p>

        <hr>

        <p>What I did to find a job in IT:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            I looked at jobs on LinkedIn and the skills requirements of employers.
          </li>
          <li>
            Selected the most common
          </li>
          <li>
            Completed courses for each of the selected skills (on Udemy and Coursera)
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>Since I was most interested in working in Data Science, among the skills that I needed to learn were:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Python and all required libraries
          </li>
          <li>
            SQL
          </li>
          <li>
            Excel|Google sheets (tool is not as important as functionality)
          </li>
          <li>
            Mathematical statistics
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>All the courses were not difficult for me, since I already had some kind of base that was given to me at the university (especially in mathematical statistics).</p>
        <p>I was pretty good at it, but since candidates without DS experience weren't considered, I'll be honest, I almost gave up. My entire portfolio on Kaggle turned out to be useless, and even more so my ability to learn quickly.</p>
        <p>But I did not give up and decided to start working in IT from scratch, from zero level (if I'm so good, then I'll be able to rise to the level that I want - I thought).</p>
        <p>And I started this process...</p>
        <p>Now I work as a Technical Support Engineer. And, to be honest, at first I thought that this was not at all what I wanted to do, but over time, I realized that if I really want to grow into an excellent IT specialist, this is a great option to start. I do not regret anything.</p>
        <p>I can not say that this is advice - by no means. I just shared my experience, especially with those who are full of the same romance as me and with burning eyes want to conquer this world.</p>
        <p>Thank you!</p>

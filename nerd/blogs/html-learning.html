        <p>Hi all! We recently wrote a post about educational resources that will help you get all the necessary skills and knowledge for web development (if you havenâ€™t read it, I advise you to read it at the <a href="frontend-resources.html">link</a>). Today we want to start a series of articles in which we will dwell on each of the skills necessary for this and start with the most basic and simple hard skill - HTML.</p>
        <p>In simple terms, HTML is the markup language of a web page and thanks to it, we decide which page element to place where. This is where every web project starts, with markup, because you canâ€™t start doing repairs if you donâ€™t have walls yet. I sincerely believe that if there is a desire to learn HTML quickly, then it can be done in 3 days. The resources that I have selected for you will help you with this.</p>
        <div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
          <strong>Note</strong>: You won't see resources like <a href="udemy-review.html">Udemy</a>, <a href="udemy-coursera.html">Coursera</a>, W3School, Codecademy, and freeCodeCamp in this list. These are classic resources, about which, so, there is already a lot of material on the net. I tried to find something new and unique for you.
        </div>        

        <p><a href="https://resumeio.sjv.io/c/3876500/1503720/17609?subId1=becomingnerd"><img src="../blogs/images/resumeio.jpeg" style="padding: 10px 0;"/></a></p>

        <h2>HTML Dog</h2>
        <p>The name is mega strange, but the resource is very good. This is essentially a collection of very high-quality and accessible tutorials for beginners and, in general, a good alternative to official documentation. Here you will find code examples, and most importantly, get the basic theory for a quick and easy start.</p>
        <img src="../blogs/images/HTML Dog - Interface.png" alt="HTML Dog - Interface">
        <p class="image-desc text-center">HTML Dog - Interface (<a href="https://www.htmldog.com/guides/html/beginner/gettingstarted/">source</a>)</p>
        <p>The format of this resource is text. Here, training takes place mainly according to tutorials, which are very correctly compiled and organized from an educational point of view. In general, this site is an excellent alternative to W3school, where only the main material is collected, without a detailed dive and problem fixes.</p>

        <script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js?client=ca-pub-5726911142858125"
              crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
              style="display:block"
              data-ad-format="fluid"
              data-ad-layout-key="-fb+5w+4e-db+86"
              data-ad-client="ca-pub-5726911142858125"
              data-ad-slot="8075272857"></ins>
        <script>
              (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>

        <p>The resource also offers tutorials on CSS and JS, but today we are focusing on HTML. By the way, I do not advise you to study JS and CSS here. These are more complex languages that require a slightly different approach (I talk about educational resources for these programming languages in detail <a href="js-resources.html">here</a> and <a href="css-resources.html">here</a>, respectively).</p>

        <h2>Sololearn</h2>
        <p>I will say honestly and immediately that I am a little skeptical about this resource, but for someone it may seem exactly what he needs. The point is that I sincerely believe that HTML is not worth paying money to <a href="effective-learning.html">learn</a> it. This markup language is quite possible to learn on your own and without any expenses. Sololearn takes a slightly different approach.</p>
        <img src="../blogs/images/Sololearn - Interface.png" alt="Sololearn - Interface">
        <p class="image-desc text-center">Sololearn - Interface (<a href="https://www.sololearn.com">source</a>)</p>
        <p>This resource customizes your personal curriculum based on your previous programming <a href="gain-experience.html">experience</a>, your age and goals. To do this, before you start, you are asked introductory three questions. After receiving a customizable training plan, you get assignments, theory and everything else that is usually in the courses. The initial level here is too simple, it seems to me that even a child will cope with such questions and tasks, but everyone has a different level of involvement in this, so this approach will seem ideal to someone.</p>
        <p>The site has a Pro subscription, and honestly it's not worth the money at all, at least if you want to learn HTML. Again, HTML can and should be learned on your own and for free. The rest of the statements will just suck money out of you. However, if you do not feel confident in your own abilities and motivation, then you can also take a closer look at this resource, but be prepared to pay for a full-fledged training.</p>
        <img src="../blogs/images/Sololearn - Prices.png" alt="Sololearn - Prices">

        </div> 

        <h2>Mozilla Developer Network (MDN)</h2>
        <p>It is impossible to talk about a programming language without documentation. MDN is the kind of documentation that you will have to work with all the time if you want to connect your future with web development, because this will be your Stack Overflow, this will be your Wikipedia, this resource will be your third parent. MDN is that classic resource that simply cannot be removed from the collection, unlike those that I mentioned at the very beginning.</p>
        <img src="../blogs/images/MDN Docs - HTML.png" alt="MDN Docs - HTML">
        <p class="image-desc text-center">MDN Docs - HTML (<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML">source</a>)</p>
        <p>We have already written a lot about this resource on our website, so I will not repeat myself and go over briefly what it is and what are the advantages here. MDN is a well-structured documentation with very high quality material written by professionals, not by an amateur copywriter.</p>
        <p>If during your training, you prefer another resource that is more suitable for you, then do not rush to look for a solution on YouTube, but come here in search of an answer to your survey. Firstly, it will be useful for you, because you will learn how to work with documentation, and secondly, here you will find the answer to any of your questions and problems in the field of web development.</p>

        <script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js?client=ca-pub-5726911142858125"

        <h2>Web.dev</h2>
        <p>Web.dev is an exceptional learning resource for anyone looking to delve into HTML and web development. Created by Google, this platform offers a wealth of comprehensive and up-to-date information on HTML, CSS, and other web technologies. The platform provides hands-on coding examples and exercises, allowing users to practice their HTML skills in a practical and engaging manner. The step-by-step tutorials guide learners through various HTML concepts, from the basics to more advanced topics.</p>
        <p>Another feature of Web.dev is its focus on best practices and web standards. The content emphasizes modern techniques, accessibility, performance optimization, and progressive web app development. This ensures that users not only learn HTML but also gain insights into creating efficient and user-friendly websites.</p>
        <img src="../blogs/images/webdev - Interface.png" alt="webdev - Interface">
        <p class="image-desc text-center">webdev - Interface (<a href="https://web.dev/learn/html/">source</a>)</p>
        <p>The platform's layout and design are user-friendly, with clear navigation and well-structured content. The documentation is detailed, yet presented in a concise and approachable manner, making it suitable for beginners and experienced developers alike. Additionally, Web.dev offers helpful tools and resources to aid learning, such as lighthouse audits, performance analysis, and web developer certification. These extra features enhance the overall learning experience and provide valuable insights into creating high-quality websites.</p>
  
        <h2>HTML5 Please</h2>
        <p>The name is mega strange, but the resource is not bad. HTML5 Please is a fantastic resource for web developers seeking guidance and support when working with HTML5. This platform offers a comprehensive collection of recommendations, tips, and compatibility information for HTML5 features.</p>
        <img src="../blogs/images/HTML5Please - Interface.png" alt="HTML5Please - Interface">
        <p class="image-desc text-center">HTML5Please - Interface (<a href="https://html5please.com">source</a>)</p>
        <p>One of the standout features of HTML5 Please is its focus on browser compatibility. The resource provides clear and detailed explanations of how to implement HTML5 features effectively while maintaining compatibility with various web browsers. This is particularly valuable in today's diverse browser landscape, ensuring a consistent user experience across different platforms.</p>
        <p>The website's layout is clean and easy to navigate, making it simple to find specific HTML5 elements or features. Each feature page provides in-depth information, including usage guidelines, known issues, and recommended fallbacks. This enables developers to make informed decisions and choose the most appropriate approach for their projects.</p>
        <p>HTML5 Please also offers various resources and tools, such as polyfills and libraries, which can aid developers in implementing HTML5 features and addressing browser compatibility concerns. These additional resources save time and effort, providing practical solutions and easing the development process.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>So, today we have identified some very important and useful resources that will help you in learning HTML, the basic programming language not only for web development, but for IT in general. I can tell from my own experience that even an information security specialist needs this programming language almost every day. I tried to find for you unique resources that are not talked about so much and often, so that you have as many choices as possible.</p>

        <p class="blog-post-meta">Jan 30, 2023</p>
        
        <p>In my opinion, it is very important for serious and corrective developmental processes not just to absorb information like an accident, but to surround yourself and deal with what you are learning. So, for example, I learned Spanish. For me, this is an immersion in the language itself - books, YouTube videos, children's cartoons, live communication and chatting in Spanish. I believe that this is the most effective learning process.</p>
        <p>In order for this to apply to the process of learning in the field of IT, it is important to take part in the study in your field, to study the opinion and experience of more experienced specialists, currently not encountered memes for you, and so on. All this rich material can be found on Reddit. It is ideal for these purposes. So I came up with the idea for this article. I intend to select the best professional communities on Reddit that will engage you in what you appreciate, make the process more fun and, most importantly, keep you interested in it.</p>
        <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CompTIA/"><h2>r/CompTIA</h2></a>
        <p>In IT, constant certification is very important, because every year a lot of things change, a lot of new things are invented. The certificates that, in my opinion, every IT specialist should have are certificates from CompTIA. They have a lot of certificates: in information security, cloud technologies, Linux administration and many others. You can find more information about the varieties of their certificates at the <a href="https://www.comptia.org/certifications">link</a>.</p>
        <img src="../blogs/images/CompTIA Certifications.png" alt="CompTIA Certifications">
        <p class="image-desc text-center">CompTIA Certifications</p>
        <p>They have a great community on Reddit, where there are a lot of newcomers to IT. Some of them are preparing to take their exam, someone has already passed and shares their experience, and someone is just wondering if this exam is worth their time and effort. In a word, this is a very friendly community where you will be helped and where you, being a professional, can help others.</p>
        
        <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/"><h2>r/cybersecurity</h2></a>
        <p>An ideal community if you want to dive into the field of information security. Beginners are very welcome here, because about half of the tags for posts here refer specifically to beginners. Here you will find answers to all questions related to careers and training (where you are very likely to encounter the CompTIA Security+ exam, which refers us to the previous community in the list).</p>
        <img src="../blogs/images/Cybersecurity Subreddit.png" alt="Cybersecurity Subreddit">
        <p class="image-desc text-center">Cybersecurity Subreddit</p>
        <p>I personally consider their section (post label) "News" to be a feature of the community, which logically refers to the latest news in the field of Information security. This allows you to immerse yourself even more in the area you are studying. Another great community, use it, but be careful - they have very strict moderators who, for the slightest non-compliance with the rules, will immediately ban you forever.</p>
        
        <p><a href="https://skillshare.eqcm.net/c/3876500/298081/4650"><img src="../blogs/images/skillshare.png" alt="skillshare promotion" style="padding: 10px 0;"/></a></p>
        
        <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/"><h2>r/webdev</h2></a>
        <p>Large community for web developers. Of course, it is frontend development that is mainly discussed here (about 95%), but this is compensated by relevant, interesting, lively threads. As with all the communities in this compilation, there are threads with questions about careers in this area, there is a discussion of the latest news, as well as threads where more experienced programmers share their experiences (these are my favorite threads).</p>
        <img src="../blogs/images/WebDev Subreddit.png" alt="WebDev Subreddit">
        <p class="image-desc text-center">WebDev Subreddit</p>
        <p>Very kind and loyal (in a good way) moderators, who sometimes allow you to deviate from the main topic of the community and discuss related topics in threads, such as Data Science and Google AdSense, for which I give them respect. One of my favorite communities that I read every day, where responsive and active members.</p>

        <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammingLanguages/"><h2>r/ProgrammingLanguages</h2></a>
        <p>If you are thinking about learning a new programming language, or you are choosing which language to learn first in your career, then this community is great for that. Here, the participants will prompt you absolutely on any issue and on any programming language, the main thing is to put the question correctly and do not forget to attach your code. Every third thread here contains code that is either problematic (with an error), or requires optimization, or vice versa, an example to follow.</p>
        <img src="../blogs/images/ProgrammingLanguages Subreddit.png" alt="ProgrammingLanguages Subreddit">
        <p class="image-desc text-center">ProgrammingLanguages Subreddit</p>
        <p>I would call this community an analogue of StackOverflow, but more modest. Of the minuses, I also want to emphasize that it is quite difficult to search for the necessary material, that is, in order to read, for example, about C ++, you need to read every thread - it is useless to search by post label here. This increases the search time, and if you read about each programming language, your head will explode.</p>

        <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/"><h2>r/ITCareerQuestions</h2></a>
        <p>I think about what this community says the name itself. Any questions related to career and education are discussed here. Lots of threads with resume reviews and salary questions. I would roughly but clearly divide the audience of this community into those who ask questions (obvious newcomers) and those who answer them (already established specialists). I think that there is no third category of people here.</p>
        <img src="../blogs/images/ITCareerQuestions Subreddit.png" alt="ITCareerQuestions Subreddit">
        <p class="image-desc text-center">ITCareerQuestions Subreddit</p>
        <p>Very responsive audience, always help and prompt, always give advice. Moderators are also very loyal (in a good way) and if a post violates any community rule, they will help correct the post in such a way as to comply with these rules. The perfect community for job hunting and interview preparation.</p>

          <div class="row g-0 border rounded overflow-hidden flex-md-row mb-4 shadow-sm h-md-250 position-relative">

              <div class="mb-1 text-muted">Jan 29</div>
              <p class="card-text mb-auto">I want to tell you about my experience of receiving wages in cryptocurrency. Share my story, the difficulties that I encountered...</p>

        <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux4noobs/"><h2>r/linux4noobs</h2></a>
        <p>Another community that I read almost every day. It is ideal for DevOps beginners and system and network administrators, because here they will clearly let you know that if you use Windows, then you made a big mistake in your life. Here they will help you choose the right distribution kit for learning to administer Unix systems if you are a beginner and tell you how to correctly compose a bash script if you are a more experienced user.</p>
        <img src="../blogs/images/Linux4noobs Subreddit.png" alt="Linux4noobs Subreddit">
        <p class="image-desc text-center">Linux4noobs Subreddit</p>
        <p>Here everyone is welcome and everyone is helped without exception. The community is very active and suitable for completely different levels of Linux proficiency. Among other communities on the list, I recommend paying attention to this one first, because other communities, in one way or another, touch on the topic of administering Unix systems.</p>

        <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SQL/"><h2>r/SQL</h2></a>
        <p>I think the very name of the community speaks for itself. This is where the database experts for DBMSs such as MySQL, Postgre SQL, MS SQL, Oracle and many, many others live. I would boldly call learning SQL the second step after administering Linux on the road to your IT career. With the study, this community will also help you.</p>
        <img src="../blogs/images/SQL Subreddit.png" alt="SQL Subreddit">
        <p class="image-desc text-center">SQL Subreddit</p>
        <p>The community, I would say, is more technical and there are no such headings as career questions and collections of educational resources. People come here with a specific question to get a specific answer. You can be that person too. Here everything works like clockwork, everything is clear.</p>


        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>This is the selection I came up with. I did not include our community in it, it would simply not be fair, although it could well compete with all of the above and, like no other, is suitable for beginners. My goal in writing this article was just to convince you that in addition to studying hard about anything, the curriculum can also include some communities on Reddit that are not recognized to make a genius out of you, but which will simply increase your horizons and perhaps orient in career terms, based on miraculous experience.</p>

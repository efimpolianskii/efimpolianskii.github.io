        <p>Hello! For my fairly extensive experience in IT, namely 8 years, I have always come across the same discussion of project managers - which tool is better, what to choose and what will be more efficient and most importantly convenient for work. - There are two most popular management tools projects between which there is a constant choice - Jira and Trello. </p>
        <p>In this article, we will understand what are the features of each of the tools and why it is important at all. Looking ahead, for those who do not want to go into details and want an answer here and now - Jira is better. And for those who need details, welcome to the next parts of our article.</p>

        <p><a href="https://resumeio.sjv.io/c/3876500/1503720/17609?subId1=becomingnerd"><img src="../blogs/images/resumeio.jpeg" style="padding: 10px 0;"/></a></p>

        <h2>Trello</h2>
        <p>Trello is a widely used web-based project management tool that offers a visual and easy-to-use interface to help teams collaborate and manage projects more efficiently. It utilizes the Kanban board system, which allows users to organize tasks into boards, lists, and cards, making it ideal for agile <a href="doc-resources.html">software development</a>, marketing campaigns, or even personal use.</p>
        <p>In 2 out of 5 companies in which I worked over these 8 years, they preferred Trello, and when I asked why this particular tool, I always received the same answer - it is simple and an employee can figure it out in the first working day. And indeed it is.</p>  
        <img src="../blogs/images/Trello - Interface.png" alt="Trello - Interface">
        <p class="image-desc text-center">Trello - Interface (<a href="https://trello.com/tour">source</a>)</p>
        <p>The user-friendly interface allows anyone to quickly get started with the tool without any significant learning curve. Users can add tasks to boards, assign due dates, and collaborate with others easily. Additionally, the tool integrates with various third-party applications, such as Google Drive, Dropbox, and Slack, to streamline workflow and increase productivity.</p>
        <p>Another significant advantage of Trello is its flexibility. Users can create custom fields, labels, and tags to make tasks more specific and relevant to their needs. Additionally, the tool offers a range of customization options, such as backgrounds and stickers, to make the boards and cards more visually appealing.</p>
        
        <script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js?client=ca-pub-5726911142858125"
              crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
              style="display:block"
              data-ad-format="fluid"
              data-ad-layout-key="-fb+5w+4e-db+86"
              data-ad-client="ca-pub-5726911142858125"
              data-ad-slot="8075272857"></ins>
        <script>
              (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
        
        <p>Trello also offers a mobile app that is available for both Android and iOS devices. This allows users to manage their tasks on-the-go and stay up-to-date with their team's progress. Additionally, the app offers push notifications, which keep users informed of any changes made to the boards.</p>
        <p>As for Cons of Trello is that it may not be suitable for large-scale projects. The tool may become cluttered and challenging to manage when there are too many tasks and boards. Additionally, some users may find the tool's lack of advanced features, such as Gantt charts and time tracking, limiting.</p>
        <p>Trello is an excellent project management tool that offers a simple, yet effective way to manage tasks and collaborate with others. Its user-friendly interface, flexibility, and integrations make it an ideal choice for small to medium-sized teams or personal use. However, it may not be suitable for larger projects that require more advanced features.</p>
        <img src="../blogs/images/Trello - Prices.png" alt="Trello - Prices">
        <p class="image-desc text-center">Trello - Prices (<a href="https://trello.com/pricing">source</a>)</p>
        <p>On our site, we don't usually talk about pricing, simply because for someone the cost of a monthly or annual plan can be huge, and for someone the same cost is like paying a cent. We will not argue about what is expensive and what is not, so we will simply provide a screenshot with details about the prices above. You yourself must decide whether this is a lot for you and your project or not.</p>

        <h2>Jira</h2>
        <p>As I said, 2 of the 5 companies I worked for chose Trello, and the remaining 3 settled on Jira, and I liked this choice much more. Now I will explain why. Jira is a popular project management tool that is widely used in software development teams. It offers a wide range of features that can help teams to plan, track and release software more efficiently. One of the key strengths of Jira is its flexibility - it can be customized to fit the needs of almost any team, regardless of their size, methodology or workflow.</p>
        <img src="../blogs/images/Jira - Interface.png" alt="Jira - Interface">
        <p class="image-desc text-center">Jira - Interface (<a href="https://support.atlassian.com/jira-work-management/docs/learn-about-the-new-jira-cloud-experience/">source</a>)</p>
        <p>Jira allows teams to create and manage tasks, issues, and projects using a variety of different views, such as Kanban boards or Scrum boards. It also offers a range of reports and dashboards that can help teams to track their progress, identify bottlenecks and make data-driven decisions.</p>
        <p>What I personally liked and what I was delighted with was that Jira integration with other tools and systems, such as Git, Confluence and Bitbucket. This allows teams to streamline their workflow and reduce the amount of time they spend switching between different tools.</p>
        
        <script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js?client=ca-pub-5726911142858125"
              crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
              style="display:block"
              data-ad-format="fluid"
              data-ad-layout-key="-fb+5w+4e-db+86"
              data-ad-client="ca-pub-5726911142858125"
              data-ad-slot="8075272857"></ins>
        <script>
              (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
        
        <p>Another pros of Jira is its extensive marketplace, which offers a wide range of plugins and add-ons that can extend its functionality even further. This allows teams to tailor Jira to their specific needs and requirements, and to create a customized workflow that suits their working style.</p>
        <p>However, Jira can also be complex and overwhelming for new users unlike Trello, particularly those who are not familiar with agile methodologies. It can take some time to learn how to use all of its features effectively, and there is a risk of teams becoming bogged down in too much detail and losing sight of the bigger picture.</p>
        <p>In short summary, Jira is a powerful project management tool that offers a range of features and integrations that can help teams to work more efficiently. While it may not be suitable for every team or project, those who are willing to invest the time and effort to learn how to use it effectively can benefit from its flexibility, customization and scalability.</p>
        <img src="../blogs/images/Jira - Prices.png" alt="Jira - Prices">
        <p class="image-desc text-center">Jira - Prices (<a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/pricing">source</a>)</p>
        <p>Again, we consider it wrong to comment on prices - is it a lot or a little for you and your project - this is your business and your conclusions. From myself, I can only say that Jira is part of the Atlassian ecosystem - each of their products is a convenient and professional solution, the quality of which should not be doubted.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>As I said at the beginning of the article, I would prefer Jira. This is an excellent, comprehensive tool that covers all the needs of project management, makes the work convenient and understandable, which increases the efficiency and <a href="productivity-cult.html">productivity</a> of the workflow. Trello is also a good software product, but it is more focused on smaller projects and is more suitable for startups than for large businesses. My choice here is obvious - Jira. I am always ready to listen to all your comments and criticism in our community on Reddit. I will be glad to see you there.</p>

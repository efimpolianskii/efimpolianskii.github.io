        <p class="blog-post-meta">April 3, 2023 • 97% Human Written</p>
        
        <p>Hello! This is a classic article of our site, where we analyze useful educational resources, give them our assessment, and also recommend what you should pay attention to when learning. Today's article is dedicated to python, one of the most important and functional programming languages.</p>   
        <p>At my first job in IT, developers told me - if you don’t know what programming language to learn, you don’t know where to start, then start with python. I initially mistook that for a joke, but it's actually a pretty wise bit of advice. I started learning python with the resources that I will tell you about in this article. I hope you find something new for yourself too.</p>

        <p><a href="https://nordvpn.sjv.io/c/3876500/512107/7452?subId1=becomingnerd"><img src="../blogs/images/nordvpn.jpeg" style="padding: 10px 0;"/></a></p>

        <h2>Learn Python the Hard Way</h2>
        <p>I decided to start with books. Someone says that learning programming languages from books is like writing code on a piece of paper. I do not agree with such people and I think that books are great for training memory.</p>
        <img src="../blogs/images/Learn Python the Hard Way - Printing Section.png" alt='Learn Python the Hard Way - Printing Section'>
        <p class="image-desc text-center">Learn Python the Hard Way - Printing Section</p> 
        <p>One of the biggest strengths of "Learn Python the Hard Way" is its focus on practical exercises. The activities in the book are broken down into a series that gradually builds on one another, letting you apply what you've learned to actual situations. Each exercise includes clear instructions and code examples, making it easy to follow along.</p>
        <p>Another highlight of the book is its emphasis on developing effective coding habits. The book highlights the value of excellent coding habits, such as commenting your code and utilizing version control, in becoming a more successful and efficient programmer.</p>

        <script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js?client=ca-pub-5726911142858125"
              crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
              style="display:block"
              data-ad-format="fluid"
              data-ad-layout-key="-fb+5w+4e-db+86"
              data-ad-client="ca-pub-5726911142858125"
              data-ad-slot="8075272857"></ins>
        <script>
              (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>

        <p>One potential downside of "Learn Python the Hard Way" is its emphasis on memorization. The book requires you to memorize a lot of code and syntax, which can be overwhelming for some learners. Additionally, the book's title can be misleading, as it's not necessarily a difficult way to learn Python, but rather an intense and focused approach.</p>
        <p>The book is available via the <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwj9iJzSlo7-AhWBQ_EDHfHuDDQQFnoECCsQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwe.riseup.net%2Fassets%2F345908%2FLearn_Python_The_Hard_Way_3rd_Edition_V413HAV.pdf&usg=AOvVaw1MOwUGlum9ynh79J8DVmQv">link</a>.</p>

        <h2>Automate the Boring Stuff with Python</h2>
        <p>One of the reason I recommend you this book is its focus on automating common, repetitive tasks. The book covers a wide range of topics, from web scraping to automating email, which can help you streamline your workflows and <a href="time-management.html">save time</a>. The author provides clear, step-by-step instructions for each project, making it easy to follow along.</p>
        <img src="../blogs/images/Automate the Boring Stuff with Python - Lists and Dics Section.png" alt='Automate the Boring Stuff with Python - Lists and Dics Section'>
        <p class="image-desc text-center">Automate the Boring Stuff with Python - Lists and Dics Section</p> 
        <p>Another strength of the book is its emphasis on practical applications. The author provides plenty of examples of how Python can be used to automate real-world tasks, which helps learners understand the relevance of what they're learning. This approach can be especially motivating for learners who are looking to apply their new skills to their work or personal projects.</p>

            </div>
          </div>
        </div>

        <p>The thing I love most of all is that the book is well-organized and easy to follow, with clear explanations of key concepts and plenty of code examples. The author does an excellent job of breaking down complex tasks into manageable steps, which can help <a href="effective-learning.html">learners</a> build their confidence as they progress through the book.</p>
        <p>Again, like the previous book I reviewed, it may be too basic for learners who are already familiar with Python. The book is aimed at <a href="junior-talents.html">beginners</a>, so if you're looking for more advanced topics or specialized applications, you may want to explore other resources.</p>
        <p>In general, is an excellent resource for beginners who are looking to learn Python with a focus on practical applications. The book's emphasis on automating common tasks, clear writing style, and comprehensive coverage of key topics make it a great choice for learners who want to build their skills in a relevant and engaging way.</p>
        <p>The book is available via the <a href="https://edu.anarcho-copy.org/Programming%20Languages/Python/Automate%20the%20Boring%20Stuff%20with%20Python.pdf">link</a>.</p>

        <h2>Python Crash Course</h2>
        <p>Another book in the list. The book includes a wide range of projects, ranging from building a simple game to developing a <a href="js-resources.html">web application</a>, which help you apply what you've learned practically. The projects are well-designed and engaging, and provide a great way to reinforce your understanding of key concepts.</p>
        <p>The book's straightforward and succinct writing style is another asset. Without oversimplifying or skipping over crucial aspects, the author does a fantastic job of articulating difficult topics in a way that is simple to comprehend. The book is a fantastic tool for self-paced study because it is well laid out and simple to follow.</p>
        <img src="../blogs/images/Python Crash Course - Testing Your Code Section.png" alt='Python Crash Course - Testing Your Code Section'>
        <p class="image-desc text-center">Python Crash Course - Testing Your Code Section</p>
        <p>"Python Crash Course" covers a broad range of topics, from basic syntax to more advanced topics like Django web <a href="replace-human.html">development</a>. This makes it a great resource for learners who are looking for a comprehensive introduction to Python.</p>
        <p>One potential downside of the book is that it may be too basic for some learners. If you already have <a href="money-or-experience.html">experience</a> with programming, you may find some of the early chapters to be too slow-paced. Also, the book skips over several more specialized subjects that you might find interesting, such <a href="data-analyst.html">data</a> analysis and machine learning.</p>
        <p>The book is available via the <a href="https://bedford-computing.co.uk/learning/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/No.Starch.Python.Oct_.2015.ISBN_.1593276036.pdf">link</a>.</p>

        <h2>Python for Everybody</h2>
        <p>"Python for Everybody" is a book written by Dr. Charles Severance that aims to teach Python to beginners with a focus on web development and data analysis.</p>
        <img src="../blogs/images/Python for Everybody - Tuples Section.png" alt='Python for Everybody - Tuples Section'>
        <p class="image-desc text-center">Python for Everybody - Tuples Section</p> 
        <p>The thorough treatment of important subjects in this book is what I like most about it. The book covers so much stuff including fundamental programming ideas, <a href="doc-resources.html">web development</a>, and <a href="data-analyst.html">data analysis</a>, making it a fantastic resource for those looking for a thorough introduction to Python. The author does a great job of breaking down complicated ideas into simple terms and includes many of code examples to highlight important ideas.</p>
        <p>Another strength of the book is its focus on real-world applications, like in a previous book in the list. The author provides plenty of examples of how Python can be used to solve real-world problems, which can help learners understand the relevance of what they're learning. This approach can be especially motivating for learners who are looking to apply their new skills to their work or personal projects.</p>
        
        <script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js?client=ca-pub-5726911142858125"
              crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
              style="display:block"
              data-ad-format="fluid"
              data-ad-layout-key="-fb+5w+4e-db+86"
              data-ad-client="ca-pub-5726911142858125"

        <script>
              (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>

        <p>Moreover, "Python for Everybody" is well-organized and easy to follow. The author breaks down complex topics into manageable sections, and provides plenty of review exercises to help learners reinforce their understanding of key concepts. The book is also available as a free online course with video lectures and interactive homework, making it a great option for self-study.</p>
        <p>As such, "Python for Everyone" is a great resource for beginners looking for a complete introduction to Python with a focus on web development and data analysis. With comprehensive coverage of key topics, real-world examples, and a well-organized format, this book is an excellent choice for learners who want to improve their skills in a fun and appropriate way. Whether you're new to Python or want to improve your web development and data analysis skills, Python for Everyone is a must-read. That was the first Python-related book I read.</p>
        <p>The book is available via the <a href="https://do1.dr-chuck.com/pythonlearn/EN_us/pythonlearn.pdf">link</a>.</p>

        <h2>Head First Python</h2>
        <p>"Head First Python" by Paul Barry is a unique and engaging book that teaches Python programming to beginners. The book uses a visual approach to <a href="teach-it.html">teaching</a>, with plenty of illustrations, diagrams, and real-world examples to make learning Python fun and easy.</p>
        <img src="../blogs/images/Head First Python - Modules Section.png" alt='Head First Python - Modules Section'>
        <p class="image-desc text-center">Head First Python - Modules Section</p> 
        <p>One of the key strengths of the book is its focus on practical examples. The author provides plenty of code examples that demonstrate how to use Python to solve real-world problems, which makes the learning experience more engaging and relevant. For instance, this book helped me a lot with real examples at my final year at university. The book also includes exercises and quizzes that help reinforce key concepts and ensure learners are retaining what they've learned.</p>
        <p>The book uses a conversational tone and a visual layout that makes it easy to follow and understand. The author breaks down complex concepts into manageable sections, and uses illustrations and <a href="euler-diagram.html">diagrams</a> to explain concepts in a way that is easy to grasp.</p>
        
        <div>
          <div class="row g-0 border rounded overflow-hidden flex-md-row mb-4 shadow-sm h-md-250 position-relative">
            <div class="col p-4 d-flex flex-column position-static">

            </div>
          </div>
        </div>

        <p>Not for me, but for somebody, it may not be the best choice for learners who prefer a more traditional approach to <a href="learning-python.html">learning programming</a>. The visual and conversational style of the book may not be appealing to everyone, and some learners may prefer a more text-heavy approach.</p>
        <p>"Head First Python" is an excellent resource for beginners who want a fun and engaging introduction to Python programming. The book's unique visual approach, practical examples, and conversational tone make it a great choice for learners who are looking for an enjoyable and effective way to learn Python. "Head First Python" is unquestionably a book you should look at if you're new to Python and want to learn the language in a fun and interesting way.</p>
        <p>The book is available via the <a href="http://bedford-computing.co.uk/learning/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Head-First-Python.pdf">link</a>.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>In this article, I have listed perhaps the best books on learning Python. Again, it may seem to some that learning Python programming is like learning to fly an airplane by jumping from a parachute. This is not so if you combine what you read with practice - repeat the scripts yourself, after each chapter, test and experiment yourself. The learning process itself should be built on your personal experiments. And the basis and basis for these experiments, you can learn from the above books.</p>

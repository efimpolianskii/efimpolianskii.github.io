        <p>The W3C Link Checker's inability to offer alternatives for correcting broken links is one drawback. Broken links must be manually updated by website owners, which can take a lot of time for bigger websites with many of broken links.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>In the end, I want to say - be sure to check the newly added pages immediately after publishing on the hosting. I know from my <a href="gain-experience.html">experience</a> that if I put this task off even for a few minutes, I will forget to do this very simple action, which takes only one second and one click. First of all, I urge you, the creators and administrators of sites, to think about the user and put yourself in the place of the user. Would you be comfortable reading the site if every second link led to a page with an error? How long would you stay on such a site? On this open question, perhaps, I will end.</p>

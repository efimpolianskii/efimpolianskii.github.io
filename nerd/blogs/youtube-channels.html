        <p class="blog-post-meta">April 7, 2023 • 97% Human Written</p>
        
        <p>Hi all! A very important blog for those who do not want to pay for education! Seriously, today I have prepared for you, the readers of this blog, a selection of YouTube channels that are quite capable of replacing full-fledged courses in various areas of IT for you. I deliberately chose them in such a way as to cover as many areas as possible.</p>
        <p>YouTube is generally a very unique thing. Here you can learn anything from anyone and absolutely free. In fact, for me, as I am sure for many, this platform has helped a lot in basic <a href="self-taught.html">education</a>. Thanks to YouTube, I graduated from university, sorting out material I didn’t understand at home on my own. With this in mind, I have prepared such a selection of free IT courses on YouTube.</p>

        <p><a href="https://skillshare.eqcm.net/c/3876500/298081/4650"><img src="../blogs/images/skillshare.png" style="padding: 10px 0;"/></a></p>

        <h2>Harvard CS50 </h2>
        <p>Harvard CS50 is a YouTube channel dedicated to the popular computer science course of the same name, offered by Harvard University. The channel features lectures and other course materials, allowing anyone with an internet connection to access a high-quality computer science education for free.</p>
        <p>The course covers a wide range of computer science topics, including programming in C, algorithms, data structures, and web development. The material is presented in a way that is accessible to beginners, but still challenging enough to keep more experienced students engaged.</p>
        
        <script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js?client=ca-pub-5726911142858125"
              crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
              style="display:block"
              data-ad-format="fluid"
              data-ad-layout-key="-fb+5w+4e-db+86"
              data-ad-client="ca-pub-5726911142858125"
              data-ad-slot="8075272857"></ins>
        <script>
              (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>

        <p>As a plus, the Harvard CS50 YouTube channel is the way the course is structured. Each lecture is well-organized and builds upon the previous ones, creating a comprehensive and cohesive learning experience. The course also includes assignments and problem sets, allowing students to apply the concepts they have learned and practice their programming skills.</p>
        <img src="../blogs/images/CS50 - Python Playlist.png" alt='CS50 - Python Playlist'>
        <p class="image-desc text-center">CS50 - Python Playlist</p>
        <p>Another advantage of the Harvard CS50 YouTube channel is the community that has formed around it. Students from all over the world participate in online forums and discussion groups, helping each other with assignments and sharing their experiences.</p>
        <p>Most of all, in the courses from this channel, I probably appreciate the quality. The courses are made as professional as possible - good sound and picture quality, good presenters who explain everything clearly and excellent pace of narration (No need to speed up the video or, on the contrary, slow it down, even if English is not your native language)</p>

        <h2>MIT OpenCourseWare </h2>
        <p>MIT OpenCourseWare is a free and open digital publication of MIT course materials that provides access to a wide range of educational resources. Their YouTube channel, which was launched in 2006, offers a variety of video lectures, tutorials, and other educational content that is accessible to anyone around the world.</p>
        <img src="../blogs/images/MIT OpenCourseWare - Math Course.png" alt='MIT OpenCourseWare - Math Course'>
        <p class="image-desc text-center">MIT OpenCourseWare - Math Course</p>
        <p>The content on the MIT OpenCourseWare YouTube channel is presented by MIT faculty members, and covers a diverse range of topics including computer science, engineering, <a href="books-statistics.html">mathematics</a>, and many other fields. The channel features playlists that cover entire courses, as well as shorter videos that focus on specific topics within a particular course. The content is well-structured and easy to follow, making it a valuable resource for students, educators, and anyone interested in expanding their knowledge in these fields.</p>

        <div>
          <div class="row g-0 border rounded overflow-hidden flex-md-row mb-4 shadow-sm h-md-250 position-relative">
            <div class="col p-4 d-flex flex-column position-static">
              <strong class="d-inline-block mb-2 text-primary">New</strong>
              <h3 class="mb-0" style="font-family: 'Ubuntu';">How to Teach Technology to Kids: Tips for Parents and Educators</h3>
              <div class="mb-1 text-muted">Apr 2</div>
              <p class="card-text mb-auto">Technology is everywhere, and kids are growing up in a world where it’s an integral...</p>

            </div>
          </div>
        </div>

        <p>Another great aspect of the MIT OpenCourseWare YouTube channel is the accessibility of the content. The videos are available to anyone with an internet connection, and there is no cost to access them. This makes it a valuable resource for those who are unable to attend MIT in person, or for those who simply cannot afford to pay for a traditional education.</p>
        <p>As for the quality... It's not as great here as in the previous example, but it's not bad either. For example, in the math courses, which I love the most, sometimes some details are not visible on the board, which makes it difficult to get further explanations. I really miss the demonstration of the screen of the electronic board. Nevertheless, the sound is always excellent, clear and understandable.</p>
        <p>MIT OpenCourseWare YouTube channel is an exceptional resource for anyone looking to expand their knowledge in a variety of fields. The high-quality videos, engaging instructors, and free accessibility make it an invaluable tool for self-learners, educators, and students alike. Whether you are looking to improve your skills in computer science, engineering, mathematics, or any other field, the MIT OpenCourseWare YouTube channel is definitely worth checking out.</p>

        <h2>Codecademy</h2>
        <p>Codecademy is an online learning platform that offers courses in various <a href="best-hard-skills.html">programming languages</a> such as HTML, <a href="css-resources.html">CSS</a>, <a href="js-resources.html">JavaScript</a>, <a href="start-python.html">Python</a>, Ruby, and <a href="learning-SQL.html">SQL</a>, among others. They also have a YouTube channel where they post videos covering different programming concepts, tips and tricks, and interviews with industry experts.</p>

        <script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js?client=ca-pub-5726911142858125"
              crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
              style="display:block"
              data-ad-format="fluid"
              data-ad-layout-key="-fb+5w+4e-db+86"
              data-ad-client="ca-pub-5726911142858125"
              data-ad-slot="8075272857"></ins>
        <script>
              (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>

        <p>One of the great things about the Codecademy YouTube channel is that the videos are very beginner-friendly. They provide clear explanations of programming concepts, making them easy to understand, even for those who are new to programming. Additionally, the videos are relatively short, usually around 5-10 minutes, which makes them perfect for those who want to learn something quickly or have a short attention span.</p>
        <img src="../blogs/images/Codecademy - R Coding Stream.png" alt='Codecademy - R Coding Stream'>
        <p class="image-desc text-center">Codecademy - R Coding Stream</p>
        <p>Another great aspect of the Codecademy YouTube channel is the diversity of topics covered. They have videos covering a wide range of programming languages, as well as videos on more specific topics like data structures and algorithms, web development, and <a href="competitive-it.html">career advice</a>.</p>
        <p>Video quality depends on the format. For example, on this channel I taught programming in R. The video lessons were presented in the format of a video conference stream in Zoom. This is an understandable and convenient option. Personally, it was convenient for me - everything was perfectly visible on the screen demo, the sound was not magical, but normal, the presenters were cheerful and explained everything clearly. In a word, sometimes the quality drops on streams due to the Internet connection of one of the conference participants, but this does not interfere with the understanding of the material.</p>
        <p>Overall, the Codecademy YouTube channel is a great resource for those looking to improve their programming skills. The videos are high-quality, <a href="junior-talents.html">beginner-friendly</a>, and cover a wide range of topics, making it a valuable resource for both beginners and experienced programmers alike.</p>

        <h2>Google Developers</h2>
        <p>Google Developers is a popular YouTube channel that offers a variety of content aimed at developers and tech enthusiasts. The channel is run by Google and features a wide range of topics including Android development, web development, machine learning, game development, and much more.</p>
        <img src="../blogs/images/Google Developers - GameDev Summit.png" alt='Google Developers - GameDev Summit'>
        <p class="image-desc text-center">Google Developers - GameDev Summit</p>
        <p>The channel provides a wealth of resources for developers of all levels, from beginner to advanced. One of the most notable features of Google Developers is the "Tech Talks" series, which offers in-depth discussions on various topics related to software engineering, including programming languages, frameworks, and tools.</p>
        <p>Another great aspect of the channel is the "Crash Course" series, which provides quick introductions to various technologies and concepts, such as <a href="learning-python.html">Python</a> programming and machine learning. The videos are well-produced and easy to follow, making them an ideal starting point for beginners.</p>
        <p>In addition to these series, the Google Developers channel also offers a variety of tutorials, conference talks, and product demos. The channel also hosts live streams and Q&A sessions, which allow viewers to interact with the developers and ask questions.</p>
        <p>Of all the resources listed in this article, this one is my least favorite. I'll explain why. The fact is that the explanations and all the lessons are built exclusively on the Google ecosystem, on the company's products, on its software. I understand why this is done, because this channel is partly an advertisement for Google products, but I don’t like it when students are so limited and sometimes not told about more convenient and profitable products.</p>

        <h2>Programming with Mosh</h2>
        <p>Google Programming with Mosh is a YouTube channel created by Mosh Hamedani, a software engineer with years of experience in the industry. The channel is dedicated to providing free educational content to aspiring developers and tech enthusiasts who want to learn various programming languages and technologies.</p>
        <p>One of the things that sets Programming with Mosh apart is the quality of its content. The channel offers in-depth tutorials on various programming languages and technologies, including <a href="js-resources.html">JavaScript</a>, Python, C#, and many more. The tutorials are well-structured and easy to follow, even for beginners. Mosh's teaching style is engaging and concise, making it easy for viewers to learn at their own pace.</p>
        <img src="../blogs/images/Programming with Mosh - Python Full Course.png" alt='Programming with Mosh - Python Full Course'>
        <p class="image-desc text-center">Programming with Mosh - Python Full Course</p>
        <p>In addition to the high-quality content, Programming with Mosh offers a wide range of topics to explore. From basic concepts to advanced programming techniques, the channel covers everything you need to know to become a successful programmer. Mosh also provides tips and tricks that can help viewers master specific programming languages and technologies.</p>
        <p>I taught Python through this channel about two years ago. These were the basics, but nevertheless, then I got a basic knowledge base with which it was easy for me to move on. This, I believe, is the goal of the author - to ensure that the viewer learns the basics and becomes interested and motivated for further learning. </p>
        <p>Unlike previous channels, this channel is author's. that is, it is led by one person (at least he is alone in the frame), this gives the lessons a more comfortable and informal atmosphere, which I personally really like.</p>
        
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>In this article, I have offered you an alternative. You can always choose where to study and with whom. But now, when you see Udemi's $100 paid course on Python, you can safely find a free and better alternative. Yes, most likely no one here will mess with you and help with something, because the channels have a very large audience, but this is called <a href="self-taught.html">self-education</a>, where you yourself look for answers to your questions.</p>

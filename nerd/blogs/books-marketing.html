        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>In conclusion, I want to say that the books I have listed in this list have shaped my entrepreneurial mindset. Perhaps, I have learned far from all the information written in them, perhaps I did not fully understand some details and points, but I have formed a general entrepreneurial mindset. I began to think more based not on my feelings and emotions, but based on analysis and numbers. I think it's worth it.</p>

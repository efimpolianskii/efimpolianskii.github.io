        <p>Hey! On our website, we talk a lot about interviews, how to behave at them and how to prepare for them. Today, we would like to talk in more detail about the very first stage in the selection of candidates for absolutely every role - the selection of candidates based on <a href="cv-tools.html">resumes</a>. Whatever you say, but your resume is your cover - no matter what's inside, everyone will initially look at how the cover suits them.</p>
        <p>We will not touch today on such aspects of the resume as the correct design, paragraphs about volunteering, or the correct heading in the resume. You will find this everywhere. We want to show you something new and tell you about the points that you can add to your resume to <a href="competitive-it.html">stand out</a> from the competition.</p>

        <p><a href="https://resumeio.sjv.io/c/3876500/1503720/17609?subId1=becomingnerd"><img src="../blogs/images/resumeio.jpeg" style="padding: 10px 0;"/></a></p>

        <h2>Note</h2>
        <p>We would like to make a small note. As you probably know, each resume should not exceed one page. The fact is that one page is an ideal format for HR specialist, because there are many candidates and they have no time to read your novels for several pages.</p>
        <p>Since we offer you quite detailed paragraphs that will take up a lot of space in your document, we suggest placing them in the "Appendices" section. This can be formatted as a link in a PDF document and link to Google Drive or your personal website (depending on what you are using). But do not place everything listed below in one document - no one will read such a wall of text, and only employers who are really interested in you will follow the link.</p>

        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
              style="display:block"
              data-ad-format="fluid"
              data-ad-layout-key="-fb+5w+4e-db+86"
              data-ad-client="ca-pub-5726911142858125"

        <h2>Parts</h2>
        <p>Let's briefly say what we want from your resume - it should differ from others not by bright pictures, but by more detailed and structured information about you. In this application, you must show yourself as a person who knows what he is capable of and knows what <a href="find-job.html">job</a> he is applying for. So, for a unique resume, we need the following parts:</p>

        <h3>Infographics</h3>
        <p>If you work in the technical field (which is most likely true, because you read our blog), then you have 100% left with some numbers and data about your work from <a href="quit-job.html">previous jobs</a>. It could be anything. This could be the number of lines of code you wrote, divided by month. This can be the total number of hours in videoconferencing also distributed by month. Or, as in my case, it can be the number of closed requests (tickets) of partners through the Help Desk b2b support system.</p>
        <center><img src="../blogs/images/Number & Status of Help Desk Tickets.png" alt="Number & Status of Help Desk Tickets (Example)" style="width: 75%;"></center>
        <p class="image-desc text-center">Number & Status of Help Desk Tickets (Example)</p>
        <p>The most important thing in your schedules is to show that you didn’t just sit at the workplace, but worked and showed results. Graphs may not show your results, but they can show your productivity and how you cope with difficulties at work, that you do not quit the things you started, and that you maintain or even increase your productivity every month.</p>

        <script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js?client=ca-pub-5726911142858125"
              crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
              style="display:block"
              data-ad-format="fluid"
              data-ad-layout-key="-fb+5w+4e-db+86"
              data-ad-client="ca-pub-5726911142858125"
              data-ad-slot="8075272857"></ins>
        <script>
              (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>

        <h3>Video</h3>
        <p>You can also attach a video about yourself to your resume. The fact is that the video format is always taken more seriously by employers. It is always more pleasant to look at a person than to read a dry text. And we didn’t even come up with this, but asked familiar HR specialists who have repeatedly helped us in writing similar articles.</p>
        <p><a href="about-yourself.html">Tell about yourself</a> in the video. This video can repeat from the CV, there is nothing wrong with that. The most important thing is not to read the text written there, but to tell it in your own words, because another goal of this video is to show your <a href="soft-skills.html">soft skills</a>, your eloquence and ability to structure the story. The video can be uploaded to YouTube by restricting access to it via the link. So you do not waste extra space and be sure that the employer will look at it. To do this, you can watch the video from the official website from the developers below.</p>
        <center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zDHStdBNbXM" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>

        <h3>Work Samples</h3>
        <p>HR specialists and the target employer love it when you talk not about the successes of the company or the team you worked for, but about your personal successes, but about what you personally achieved. You can talk about it in a video, but you can show concrete results simply by posting a small piece of your work in the application. Since it is forbidden to take away data from the workplace, you can change them by notifying the HR specialist in advance in a small footnote at the end of the page.</p>
        <p>Again, this can be anything and depends on what you are doing. For me, these were pieces of dashboards that I did as a <a href="data-analyst.html">data analyst</a>. These were charts and graphs. For some, it may be fragments of documentation (if you were a technical writer) or ready-made designs (if you are a web designer) or pieces of algorithms (if you are a developer).</p>
        <center><img src="../blogs/images/Work Sample Example.png" alt="Work Sample Example" style="width: 75%;"></center>
        <p class="image-desc text-center">Work Sample Example</p>
        <p>In general, this is very similar to your portfolio, but with the difference that here you give very concise information, only bits and pieces and change values to avoid violations of the non-disclosure agreement (if there was one). Also, unlike a <a href="kaggle-portfolio.html">portfolio</a>, here you bring real cases that you have already worked with, and not specially created to demonstrate skills.</p>

        <h3>Certifications</h3>
        <p>In the resume, everyone indicates their <a href="certifications.html">certificates</a>. Someone will ask - what's new here? Everything is very simple. For some reason, many people indicate only their presence, the name and the organization that issued these certificates, but no one writes about how these <a href="free-courses.html">courses</a> and certificates helped in their professional career. You can write about the availability of a certificate in the main part of the resume, but we advise you to place information about what you learned and how it came in handy in the application.</p>
        <p>Tell about why you decided to take this course and what problems you wanted to solve by taking this course. If you took a course on <a href="seo-checklist.html">SEO</a>, then tell why you took it and what you were going to do with the information received after passing it. What motivated you to take this course - a personal initiative or a work necessity. Why this particular course and no other.</p>
        <p>Answer in the application all the questions we posed above, and you will get at least a few paragraphs for each certificate received. HR specialists love it when you don’t just throw out information about what you know and do, but clearly understand why you need it and how it will help you in the future.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>I really hope that our advice will bring you closer to your dream job. Thanks to just a few points, the appendix to your resume will reveal you in a new way, as not just a qualified specialist with a rich store of knowledge and <a href="best-hard-skills.html">skills</a>, but also as an educated person who knows what it is capable of. Don't ignore these tips. Good luck!</p>

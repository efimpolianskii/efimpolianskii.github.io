        <p>In the fast-paced and ever-evolving world of information technology, effective project management is crucial for the successful implementation and delivery of IT projects. To navigate this dynamic field, professionals need to adopt best practices and continuously update their skills. This article explores some essential best practices in IT project management and recommends courses to enhance your expertise in this field.</p>
        <p>We talked to young project managers with 1 to 3 years of experience and selected from them identified the most important success factors at the initial stage of development, which were important to identify an interest in attracting attention, as well as the possession of such skills and good knowledge. the first months of a career to feel the development in the future.</p>

        <h2>Embrace Agile Methodologies</h2>
        <p>Agile project management has gained significant popularity in recent years due to its flexible and iterative approach. Agile methodologies, such as Scrum and Kanban, focus on delivering value incrementally and fostering collaboration among team members. Here, the guys we asked for recommendations suggested the Agile Fundamentals course from Pluralsight.</p>
        <img src="../blogs/images/Pluralsight - Agile Fundamentals.png" alt="Pluralsight - Agile Fundamentals">
        <p class="image-desc text-center">Pluralsight - Agile Fundamentals (<a href="https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/agile-fundamentals?clickid=3l%3AQf1yP6xyNUEFX6ETKYS8DUkAXkwx8NRJESQ0&irgwc=1&mpid=1193463&aid=7010a000001xAKZAA2&utm_medium=digital_affiliate&utm_campaign=1193463&utm_source=impactradius">source</a>)</p>
        <p>All the necessary information is collected here - no more, no less, only what is needed at the first stages of work, at the first projects and interviews. We stopped at this particular course, since it does not overload the brain, does not provide unnecessary information and does not go into details, since, again, this is completely unnecessary at the first stages.</p>

        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
              style="display:block"

              data-ad-layout-key="-fb+5w+4e-db+86"
              data-ad-client="ca-pub-5726911142858125"

        </script>

        <p>In terms of cost, a subscription to Pluralsight costs $9 per month. It's up to you to decide if it's worth the money or not. Our opinion about the courses on this platform and about the platform itself as a whole, we expressed in this article. If you're interested, feel free to take a look.</p>

        <h2>Develop Strong Leadership Skills</h2>
        <p>Successful IT project managers possess strong leadership skills to guide their teams towards project success. Leadership courses can help you enhance your abilities in areas such as team motivation, conflict resolution, and decision-making. Agree that it is worth recommending courses for the development of these skills, since each of us is unique in his own way, and it is difficult for an introvert (like me, for example) to develop such skills in oneself. Possibly, but difficult.</p>
        <img src="../blogs/images/Good to Great by Jim Collins.png" alt="Good to Great by Jim Collins">
        <p class="image-desc text-center">Good to Great by Jim Collins (<a href="https://www.booksfree.org/good-to-great-by-jim-collins-pdf-free-download-a/">source</a>)</p>
        <p>Therefore, it is difficult for me to offer a course for the development of these skills, however, I want to offer you a book - Good to Great by Jim Collins. This book will NOT teach you how to be a tough boss, solve problems in 1 minute and communicate with everyone as if everything here depends only on you. No. It will teach you how to make smart decisions, not perfect ones, and also show you how important it is to be a smart leader, and not overbearing, with very worthy and demonstrative examples.</p>
        <p>Don't let the description of the book and its title fool you. The author generally talks about how great companies grow from just a good company, what influences this and whether there is a pattern in these factors. So, spoiler, one of the most important factors is a worthy leader. I highly recommend reading the book as I don't want to give any more spoilers.</p>

        <h2>Master Project Management Tools</h2>
        <p>Proficiency in project management tools is essential for efficient planning, scheduling, and collaboration. Courses on popular project management tools like <a href="jira-trello.html">Trello or Jira</a> can help you harness their full potential. Learn how to effectively utilize these tools to manage tasks, track progress, and communicate with stakeholders, streamlining your project management workflow.</p>
        <p>I will say right away and honestly, most of those with whom we talked, and by the way, I also learned these tools in practice and from the first working day. Personally, I clicked on everything just to empirically find out what this or that function does, and this is not correct, because with this approach, you can disrupt or slow down the work of your team members. Do not do as we do - this is a mistake, and we admit it.</p>
        <img src="../blogs/images/Jira - Official Documentation.png" alt="Jira - Official Documentation">
        <p class="image-desc text-center">Jira - Official Documentation (<a href="https://confluence.atlassian.com/jira">source</a>)</p>
        <p>Jira is used more often, as it is designed for larger companies and teams. That is why we advise you to read its official documentation (working with Trello will be exactly the same). A lot of the stuff here is intuitive, but instead of clicking on everything and hoping for luck, spend one evening reading the documentation. It is not boring and is very easy to read.</p>

        </script>

        <h2>Gain Domain-Specific Knowledge</h2>
        <p>IT project managers must possess a solid understanding of the technologies and processes relevant to their projects. Look for courses that provide domain-specific knowledge. It can be anything and depends solely on the company you are applying for. Most often, it is at the entrance tests and interviews that they ask and pay special attention to computer networks. 4 out of 7 people we talked to confirmed this.</p>
        <p>I myself had questions about computer networks, although I got a job as a manager in a technical support group. Again, itâ€™s difficult to recommend something specific here, since the course will directly depend on the companyâ€™s activities, but we still recommend that you read about networks.</p>
        <img src="../blogs/images/Networking for Dummies - Book.png" alt="Networking for Dummies - Book">
        <p class="image-desc text-center">Networking for Dummies - Book (<a href="http://www.nortonaudio.com/Ficheiros/1118474082.Netwo.pdf">source</a>)</p>
        <p>We have a separate article about computer networks and amazing books about it. If you haven't feel free to read it, I recommend checking out the <a href="networking-books.html">link</a>. Since you are not a computer network engineer, I think that the Networking for Dummies book will be enough for you (and not even in its entirety, but only the first two chapters). The material here is presented very simply, it seems to me that it was written just for such purposes.</p>
  
        <h2>Enhance Risk Management Skills</h2>
        <p>Managing risks is crucial in IT project management, where technology landscapes are continually evolving. This advice is not from the guys interviewed, but exclusively from me. I was taught a course on risks at the university, and I still carry this knowledge that I was given there in my head. Here we can recommend a free risk management course from HSC.</p>
        <img src="../blogs/images/HSC - Risk Management Course.png" alt="HSC - Risk Management Course">
        <p class="image-desc text-center">HSC - Risk Management Course (<a href="https://www.oxfordhomestudy.com/courses/risk-management-online-courses/risk-management-free-course#">source</a>)</p>
        <p>The course calls itself short, but it lasts 20 hours, which can hardly be called a short course. In general, you will find everything you need here - from simple mathematical calculations of losses to making basic forecasts. It's the basics, you don't need more. At the end of the course, you will even receive a certificate, which is rare for a free course - believe me, I know.</p>

          <h1>100+ Unique and Effective IT Educational Resources in 2023</h1>
          <p>Hello and welcome to our improvised archive. Here you can find 100+ courses and other educational resources recommended by our team and the entire <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/becomingnerd/">Reddit community</a>. We have collected in one place only the material that will help you develop professionally and grow, which are worthy of your attention.</p>
          <input type="text" id="filterInput" oninput="filterContent()" placeholder="Start typing hard skill, your budget or level of proficiency">
          <p>Results according to your query:</p>
        </div>

          <div id="itemContainer"></div>
        
          <div id="resultDiv" class="result"></div>

        <div>
          <hr>
          <p>*Each resource you find in this collection has been selected by either our media team, members of the Reddit community, or our readers. Our goal is very simple - we want our readers to have the opportunity to rely on the opinion of our media, so that our reader has an archive of resources verified by professionals to achieve all career and personal goals without exception.</p>
          
          <h2>About this Search Engine</h2>
          <p>100+ Unique and Effective IT Educational Resources were selected by specialists in their IT niche, they were not chosen by popularity or average reviews of other users, only by professionals who know and understand their niche, understand what the requirements of the labor market are for such specialists, that they must be able to work with. We talk in more detail about the ideology of our team and the ideology of our entire resource in this <a href="../blogs/education-investments.html">article</a>. We recommend to read it.</p>
          <p>If you yourself are a specialist with a wealth of experience in self-education and know very well and catch what educational resources a student should spend time on and what not, if you want to share this with others, then you are exactly where you need to be. We really appreciate the experience and knowledge of our community, and therefore we created a separate <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/becomingnerd/comments/13egpet/useful_resources_links_searcher/">thread</a> on Reddit, where you can share unique and effective resources of yours with everyone (as an alternative, you can use the <a href="../feedback.html">feedback</a> form, we regularly read feedback to our site, so we will not miss your message). Later, after a little moderation, this resource will be added to our search engine.</p>
          <p>When experts converse and share their experiences, communication may come to conclusions much more quickly, and you will no longer rely on your own instincts and intuition but rather on someone else's experience. Take use of other people's errors and ways to fix them rather than trying to create the wheel.</p>
          <p>Why take the effort to create a <a href="../blogs/cv-tools.html">resume</a> from scratch when there are so many pre-made templates available on the internet that have been assembled by skilled designers and HR professionals. Why spend effort on personal debugging when there are a million <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a> articles on this error? If there are people willing to share their experience with you since they have previously gone through it, why check on personal experience to see if this information is useful for <a href="../blogs/self-taught.html">self-education</a> or not? Why spend personal time on this when it might be used for something more productive? Trust those who have already experienced it.</p>
          
          <h2>What we achieved</h2>
          <p>This is how the concept for our website was conceived. Our team has together those who are accustomed to finding solutions on their own and those with inflated egos who are unwilling to seek assistance from those who can find a solution to a problem in a flash. That's not acceptable. We are quite aware of this, thus we have built a location that addresses this issue in part.</p>
          <p>We have established a place on the internet where anybody may check the value of the content they have chosen for themselves before learning a new skill or subject. Initially, it was a blog, which was a very practical format for these uses. Later, however, we wanted to save our readers even more time and effort, so we established a search engine ("100+ Unique and Effective IT Educational Resources") where users may input keywords to access a vast library of information that has been deemed helpful and reliable by our community.</p>
          <p>Our philosophy is really straightforward: if someone chooses to self-educate, then he already possesses the drive, willpower, and desires we need. By pushing this student in the right direction, we may avoid wasting time and effort on futile searches and worrying that the student would make the wrong decision.</p>
          <p>We appreciate the efforts and work of those who learn something new and improve themselves. This archive is made primarily for such people. We do not set ourselves the goal of advertising or promoting any resources, but rather draw your attention to those unique IT educational resources that you did not even notice before or doubted their effectiveness. We really hope that here you will find what you are looking for, and if not, feel free to come back at any time, because our improvised archive is constantly updated. Good luck!</p>
